This was part of a personal project to work on my skills. Such as using Excel cleaning tools, to organize and prepare the data for analysis. Applying pivot tables to uncover trends and summarize key mattrics, and making an interactive dashboard with slicers and charts. this turned messy data into a professional, decision-support tool.

I worked with a massive dataset that required extensive cleaning and transformation. Using Python and Pandas, I handled missing values, standardized formats, and optimized the data for analysis. Once the data was structured, I leveraged Seaborn to create clear, insightful visualizations that highlighted patterns, correlations, and key trends.
